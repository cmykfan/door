# door
Door script in Python, allowing user input.

This is a simple script in Python allowing user input.  I am practicing raw_input as well as if, elif and else statements.
I still need to figure out how to create a break at the end so if you have more than three tries of not selecting left or right
  the program will break.
  
I have been running this using OSX/MACOS 10.12.6 and the built in terminal.  Change the directory in the terminal
  to where you have downloaded the door.py script and then type "python door.py" without quotes and the script should run
  and allow you to select a left or right door.
